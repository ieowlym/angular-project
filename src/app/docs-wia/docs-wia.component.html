  </h1>
  <p>This topic can help you understand Angular: what Angular is, what advantages it provides, and what you might expect as you start to build your applications.</p>
  <p>Angular is a development platform, built on <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>. As a platform, Angular includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
    <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
    <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
  </ul>
